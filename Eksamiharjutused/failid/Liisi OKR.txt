Kuidas saada kasutajateni?

Kokkuvõte - Juuni lõpus 

From July forward - when most of my current projects will "sunset" and Pactera will be capable of owning the E2E localization process for the remaining ones, I
will concentrate mainly on 2 areas - Experimentation and Bot framework.

Experimentation

As this is totally new area for me, I would first need to study carefully all the background information that is already available on this topic.
After getting more familiar with the matter, I would like to investigate the areas where we as a team could benefit using Experimentation framework.
Similarly to what has already been mentioned in the detailed documentation - I would focus mainly on local user experience.

Bot framework

I have gradually started with my Bot studies beside Aigars already from this quarter. 
So far we have been focused on SkypeLocFeedbackBot, which is almost ready to release its vol.1, however I am certain there are some functionality improvements available
The topic itself is much wider than the rest and I'd definitely need more time
to focus on this to get better understanding of how it all works (from more technical point of view).
